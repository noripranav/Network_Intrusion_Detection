## 📌 Overview

This project aims to detect anomalies in network traffic using various machine learning models. We explore and compare six popular algorithms—Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and Naive Bayes—on a benchmark intrusion detection dataset.

Our goal: **Build an accurate, robust, and scalable Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**.

## ✨ Key Highlights

- ✅ Binary classification: **Normal vs Malicious**
- 📊 Performance evaluated using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**
- 🚀 Best performing model: **Random Forest (99.5% Accuracy)**
- 📁 Dataset: Kaggle Network Intrusion Detection Dataset

3.🚀 Running the Application

For Windows :
```bash
# Run the app
python app.py
```

For Linux :
```bash
# Run the app(sudo mode is required)
sudo python3 app.py
```

- Open your browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
- The web interface will load.

4. 🌐 Using the Web Interface
   
Option A: 📡 Real-Time Traffic Capture
Click the "Capture Real Traffic" button on the webpage.

Wait approximately 1-1.5 minute for real-time anomaly detection results to appear.

Option B: 📁 Upload CSV Test Data
Upload the file Test_data.csv provided in the repository.

This file contains a large dataset — please wait up to 5 minutes for results to process.

⚠️ Do not modify any backend files (Python, HTML, etc.) while the app is running in the browser — doing so may interrupt processing.

📎 Notes
For Windows: Make sure Npcap is installed before running the app.

Ensure all developer settings are correctly enabled if you're using Windows.

The app uses live network traffic, so admin/sudo privileges are necessary.

## 📈 Results & Conclusion

Random Forest consistently outperformed other models in both accuracy and generalization. Despite its simplicity, Logistic Regression also performed competitively. Models like KNN and GMM lagged behind in inference time and assumptions.

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Ensemble methods like Random Forest are powerful for IDS tasks due to their robustness and low overfitting tendencies.
